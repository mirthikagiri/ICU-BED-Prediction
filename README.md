# ICU-BED-Prediction
Project aims to predict the demand for ICU beds in hospitals using machine learning models, enabling better resource planning and emergency preparedness.
Predictive Modeling: Implemented and compared multiple models including:
Linear Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
Random Forest Regressor
Performance Evaluation: Used MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to evaluate model accuracy and effectiveness.
